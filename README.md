# Predicting Employee Promotion

This project aims to predict which employees are most likely to be promoted based on a dataset that includes various features such as performance metrics, work experience, and other relevant factors. The dataset, hr_data.csv, contains detailed information on employees, including personal information, education background, past performance, and more. 

This is an improved version of my Machine Learning assignment, which was part of my Diploma of Information Technology Machine Learning course at Polytechnic. 

## Contents
The project folder consists of two Jupyter Notebooks.
1. The first notebook focuses on data understanding and data cleaning processes. It uses a messy dataset from a CSV file named hr_data.csv. The output of this notebook is a cleaned CSV file named listings_new.csv, which will be used in the subsequent steps.
2. The second notebook focuses on choosing and optimizing machine learning models. It utilizes the cleaned data from the hr_data_new.csv file generated in the first notebook.
